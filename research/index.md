<div style="text-align: center">Abstract<br/>

<div style="text-align: justify">

Estimating the politician positions of parties and politicians is key to understanding party polarization 
and electoral competition. This thesis quantitatively investigates how 2008 Taiwan electoral reform through 
single non-transferable voting (SNTV) to single-member districts system (SMDs) impacts the behavior of legislators
 and their electoral strategies, by analyzing roll calls and parliamentary questions. I aim to deliver several pieces 
 of empirical evidence to revisit the following research questions: (1) Does the switch of the electoral system to 
 SMDs mitigate political polarization among parties? (2) Does the reform influence the intra-party competition, and thus,
change legislators’ policy positions? (3) Does the reform reduce regional particularism expressed in declared 
opinions in parliamentary questions, but increase the promises of universalism policies? (4) How does the reform impact local politics at 
municipal level? Does mayor with more prior years of experience as an elected legislator have a wider privileged access to increase their chances of securing
the money to their municipality and if so, how?
The dissertation project is to apply ideal point estimation and natural language processing techniques that are currently deployed by the 
forefront study of legislatures and strengthen the understanding of Taiwan party politics and party competition inside 
the Legislative Yuan. These potential findings can further help policymakers clarify possible outcomes of the electoral reform, shedding light on party competition and party polarization in modern democracies.

**Chapter 1: Electoral Reform and Disunited Polarization: Evidence from Legislative Roll Calls**
(Presentation at APSA 2020 & MPSA 2022)

This article investigates the strategic (inter- and intra-) party positioning in response to an electoral system transition 
from single non-transferable vote (SNTV) to single-member districts (SMDs) by studying the electoral reform in Taiwan and 
provides empirical evidence to the following questions. Does the switch of electoral system from SNTV to SMDs mitigate political polarization 
among parties? Does it influence the intra-party unitedness (cohesiveness), and thus, change legislators’ ideological positioning? 
To this end, I estimate individual legislator’s ideological positions from sessional roll call votes continuously covering ex-ante and ex-post
periods of the reform, from 1992 to 2015. The preliminary finding suggests that in the electoral transition from SNTV to SMDs,
ideological positions between two major parties are drastically polarized. 
In the meanwhile, this electoral transition significantly dis-unifies co-partisan legislators on the ideological spectrum. 
In addition, co-partisan legislators became ideologically distant (disunited) while opponents polarized themselves. These findings help clarify possible outcomes of the electoral reform from SNTV to SMDs, shedding light on party polarization and party competition in modern democracies.

**Chapter 2: Electoral Reform and Pork Barrel in Parliamentary Questions** (Presentation at [COMPTEXT 2022](https://www.comptextconference.org/) | [ECPR 2022](https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PanelDetails/12193))

Measuring legislator behaviours and tendencies towards constituencies under the different systems is important. This paper quantitatively investigates 
the topic using Taiwan Legislative Yuan's case and data on written parliamentary questions through an electoral reform 
from multi-member districts (MMD) to single-member districts (SMD). With existing labelled pork legislation, I 
train a deep learning model to measure pork-barrel features on parliamentary questions. Evidence exists to show that legislators under 
MMD are more likely to express political intention about pork-barrel projects in written parliamentary questions. 
The reform subsequently demonstrates heterogeneous effects on major parties vis-à-vis minority parties, respectively.

**Chapter 3: Measuring Party Cohesion on Parliamentary Question Keywords** ([<span style="color:#778899"> co-authored with Calvin Yu-Ceng Liao, Post Doctoral Research Fellow at Taiwan Studies Center, National Chengchi University</span>](https://sites.google.com/view/calvin-yuceng-liao/home) | Presentation at APSA 2022)

Understanding the positions of parties and legislators is key to conceptualizing party cohesion and their representation in most democracies. This study is to measure intra-party heterogeneity and variability in issue attention by looking at what and why legislators are more likely to oversight the ministry officials on one specific topic or another during the question time. We answer this question using the case of Taiwan Legislative Yuan, and data on written parliamentary questions through an electoral reform from 1993 to 2020. We estimate the position of each legislator on the left-right dimensions using the keywords extracted from the questions that legislators request for information on policies and activities of ministries from executive officials. We document how the electoral reform shapes legislators' ideological position and variability on their issue attentions: party cohesion increases when high variability in issue attention in Single Member District (SMD) and decreases when low variability under Single Non-transferable Vote (SNTV). These findings shed new light on providing a different approach to estimating party cohesion as well as to understanding the changes of political behaviour in representation and political accountability through the electoral reform.

**Chapter 4: Mayors and Pork Barrel: Legislative Experience Bias in Intergovernmental Transfers to Taiwan Municipalities**（Presentation at EPSA 2019)

This paper examines the contribution of mayor’s political career within governments in obtaining more distributive benefits to her own municipality. Mayors with more sophisticated experience have stronger electoral ties to the central government, which is useful for them to enhance their chances of staying in office. Using panel dataset of Revenue Support Grant, we find that municipalities whose mayors with longer career spent in the legislature are more likely to be allocated higher fiscal expenditures. The effect is even stronger if the mayors have worked in legislative standing committees. On the contrary, mayors’ prior political career in ministries does not significantly help their municipalities obtain the grant. The findings suggest that compared to experience as a central government official, a legislative career has a leading impact on grant transfer to municipalities.

**Factionalism and the Red Guards under Mao’s China: Ideal Point Estimation Using Text Data** (with Yi-Nung Tsai, National Chengchi University; Daniel Tene, Univeristy of Essex;  Dechun Zhang, Leiden University | Presentation at Asian PolMeth VIII 2020)

In this paper, we design a new strain of text scaling method, Swordfish (Slogan-featured Wordfish), that takes advantage of the TextRank algorithm to extract the most representative political slogans in a given context and estimates \textsf{Wordfish} with those extracted text variables. We test this method using the case of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the historical archive of handwritten big-character posters and self-printed tabloids from 1966. We estimate student protests' ideal points by analyzing expressed political views in propaganda publications. Our findings point to evidence of factional re(de)alignments within the movement and demonstrate how the students from different educational backgrounds followed Mao Zedong and Xiaohongshu 小紅書 (Little Red Book) and then fell into armed conflicts that divided families, the classes and the society. The results estimated by our approach are shown to be consistent with the representative qualitative literature of factionalism regarding the Cultural Revolution.</div>

**State-led Nationalism: Measuring China’s Online Nationalists on Weibo** (with [<span style="color:#778899"> Dechun Zhang, Leiden University</span>](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/dechun-zhang#tab-1))

Measuring Chinese nationalism on social media is essential to understand the operation of propaganda strategies used by
the government to advance advertisements in its legitimacy and governance in China. 
This research note follows the literature on Chinese nationalism and operationalizes major nationalistic 
concepts commonly found in Sina Weibo (China's most popular social media platform). 
We introduce a machine classifier that identify nationalistic attributes and its probability of being categorized as an attitude of belligerent nationalism on Weibo. 
We train our model using comments and posts from China's state-controlled media, *People's Daily*, on more than one million spanning 
different political incidents through 2018 to 2022. The training source consists of 13,200 Weibo comments, 4,871 nationalistic comments and 8,329 non-nationalistic comments, respectively. 
With CNN trained on top of the BERT layer, the model performance achieves 91\% in F1-Score and 92\% in the weighted average, respectively. 
Recommendations are also included on applying our machine classifier to related textual sources for future research on Chinese politics.

**Party Misperception, Party-voter Incongruence and Political Distrust** (with Li Tang, Middlesex University London and Univeristy of Essex | Presentation at MPSA 2022)

To what extent do misperceptions of party positions affect voters' perception of representation and satisfaction with democracy? This paper offers an explanation using the case of the UK and data from the British Election Survey (BES) and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES). We show that voters' perceptional gaps in understanding party positions contribute to political incongruence between party and voters, subsequently deteriorating their trust and satisfaction with government. From our analysis, the misperceptions about UK parties increase both perceived and actual incongruence between voters and parties, with those with higher perceptional gaps demonstrating higher party–voter incongruence. This perceptional gap further contributes to citizen distrust and dissatisfaction towards the political system.

**This is What We Hope: Estimating Perceptions on Political Trust** (with Li Tang, Middlesex University London and Univeristy of Essex; Tzu-Ping Liu, University of Taipei)

We propose a new approach to estimating voters' preferences on party positions, including aggregate subjective targets of Conservative Party's and Labour Party's positions, based on their political confidence towards the government, that requires no priors on the underlying data-generating process of the targets. Our approach entails directly measuring voters' confidence from the self-reported public trust towards the Parliament surveyed by British Election Study during 2017 and 2019. This paper first documents robust evidence that voters with different partisan affiliations prefer parties to locate differently: when parties move closer to the targets, the corresponding representative voter gains satisfaction and trust in the Parliament. Then, we find the estimated targets persistently deviate from perceptions of experts from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey in varying degrees, regardless of personal attributes and party affiliations. Interestingly, low-income voters from Conservative Party have targets that are more prone to disagree with experts' perceptions than high-income voters. These findings shed new light on new approach to capturing voters' preference on party positions as well as discrepancy between actual party positions and voters' perception on political parties.

**官僚團體如何「重寫」意識形態陳述：以《人民日報》習近平思想的評論為例** (with Yi-Nung Tsai, National Chengchi University)

意識形態體系在維繫中共政權的執政穩定，長期扮演了重要角色。雖然部分觀察透過分析中共制定意識形態的過程，指出官定的意識形態非鐵板一塊，而是黨內政治衝突的折衷結果。
不過，類似研究卻較少觸及意識形態建構完成後，黨內的官僚團體，如何透過各自的話語體系，將意識形態「改寫」成符合其利益偏好的政治陳述。在本文，我們以《人民日報》習近平思想的報刊評論為例，
並根據Tsai與Kao（2013）發展的「寫作組」概念，在資料蒐集過程根據評論的主題與作者，標記其所屬官僚團體。
在分析策略上，我們使用使用自動摘要生成技術（Automatic Text Summarization）的TextRank演算法，萃取文本的關鍵詞建立主題模型（topic model）。
研究發現，我們認為這些討論習近平思想的評論，會依據不同主題與作者，在關鍵詞的使用存在差異，這反映其代表官僚團體，透過差異性的話語敘事，標示其政治立場。
整體而言，我們的研究呈示了官僚團體，透過意識形態「包裝」其利益表達的陳述政治（discourse politics）。
