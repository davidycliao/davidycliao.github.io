**Electoral Incentives and Pork: Exploring Parliamentary Questions Using Convolutional Neural Networks** (Paper III / PhD Dissertation Project)

(Presented a [poster](https://github.com/davidycliao/elp) at 2021 Machine Learning Summer School [`programme`](https://aintu.org/mlss2021/landing-page/))

In this paper, we quantitatively investigate legislators' electoral strategies and communication style by applying a deep learning model for measuring pork-barrel features on the parliamentary questions from 1993 to 2020.  To incorporate this application into our analysis, we have trained a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow 2.6 on the human-labelled pork-barrel legislation, including the bills and the amendments from Taiwan Legislative Yuan. The collection of legislation was manually labelled with binary-instance classification by reading the text, devoted either to promoting the pork-barrel project in a district (earmarked projects) or cultivating favoured minorities by providing subsidies. In the context of the text classification task, the trained model essentially learns the condensed features of bag-of-words instead of learning the pattern from the entire corpus. With the pork-barrel style features measured by the model, we find that legislators under SNTV (single non-transferable voting ) are likely to express political intension with regards to pork barrel projects in the parliamentary questions and seek personal votes by promising particularistic benefits to their targeted supporters. Consistent with the literature, switching from SNTV to Single-Member Districts reduces legislators' incentives to propose particularistic benefits but increases the attention to universalism (national) policies.

**Income Inequality, Party Misperception and Democracy Distrust** 

(with Royce Carroll, University of Essex; Li Tang, University of Essex; and  Tzu-Ping Liu, University of Taipei)

This paper studies an important political channel, through which income inequality transforms into dissatisfaction with democracy and distrust towards government, using multiple waves of the British Election Study from 2015 t o 2019. We first document that households of different wealth have persistent gaps in the degree of satisfaction with democracy and governmental trust, regardless of their gender, education, party affiliation, survey waves, etc. Low-income earners are more dissatisfied with how democracy works and more distrustful of the government than affluent households. Then we show that income inequality has causal effects on misperceptions about political parties, that is, the extent to which households wrongly placed their beliefs towards parties' left-right position from reality, measured by the British Election Study Expert Survey. Households of low income perceive party positions less accurately than households of affluence and, therefore, have more significant misperceptions. Finally, we verify the causality from the size of party misperception to dissatisfaction with democracy and distrust towards the government: observing the actual party positions, low-income households are more disapp ointed by the more significant discrepancy between th eir perceived and actual party position and become more dissatisfied and distrustful of the democracy and the government.

**2021 Factionalism and the Red Guards under Mao’s China: Ideal Point Estimation Using Text Data** 

(with Yi-Nung Tsai, National Chengchi University; Dechun Zhang, Leiden University, presented in 2021 AsianPolmeth Presentation VIII | 2021 EPSA) [[`code`](https://github.com/davidycliao/redguards)][[`slides`](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/redguards/master/slides/slides.pdf)][[`paper`]()]

This article estimates the spatial positioning of the political elites and participants in the Cultural Revolution through analyzing expressed political views in propaganda publication in China. Prior theoretical research indicates that the political elites and the Red Guards lost control of the social movement, and it evolved into sheer verbal violence and physical skirmishes across all provinces in the end. We show that in this political chaos, the Red Guards and the elite were dynamically fractioned, as is reflected in self-printed propaganda, such as big-character posters (Dazibao 大字报) and tabloids (Xiaobao 小报). This paper also develops a novel approach that augments TextRank algorithm to extract keywords and Chinese phrases, on top of the Poisson scaling model (Wordfish) to estimate the differences of spatial positions using the extracted textual key terms. Results are shown to be consistent with the literature on the Cultural Revolution.

**2020 Electoral Reform and Disunited Polarization: Evidence from Legislative Roll Calls** (Paper II / PhD Dissertation Project)

(Presented in the Virtual 2020 APSA with [<span style="color:#323434"> **Li Tang, University of Birmingham**</span>](https://sites.google.com/view/litang2020)) [[`slides`](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/erdp/master/slides/slides.html#1)][[`paper`](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/erdp/master/paper/David-YCLIAO-POPE-Feb-24.pdf)]

This article investigates the strategic (inter- and intra-) party positioning in re- sponse to an electoral system transition from single non-transferable vote (SNTV) to single-member districts (SMDs) by studying the electoral reform in Taiwan and pro- vides empirical evidence to the following questions. Does the switch of electoral system from SNTV to SMDs mitigate political polarization among parties? Does it influence the intra-party unitedness (cohesiveness), and thus, change legislators’ ideological positioning? To this end, we estimate individual legislator’s ideological positions from sessional roll call votes continuously covering ex-ante and ex-post periods of the reform. Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied to a dynamic ideal point model to estimate each legislator’s position from 1992 to 2015, where individual recursively updates her prior of ideal point. The preliminary finding suggests that in the electoral transition from SNTV to SMDs, ideological positions between two major parties are drastically polarized. In the meanwhile, this electoral transition significantly dis-unifies co-partisan legislators on the ideological spectrum. In addition, co-partisan legislators became ideologically distant (disunited) while opponents polarized themselves. These findings help clarify possible outcomes of the electoral reform from SNTV to SMDs, shedding light on party polarization and party competition in modern democracies.

**2019 Mayors and Pork Barrel: Legislative Experience Bias in Intergovernmental Transfers to Taiwan Municipalities** (Paper I / PhD Dissertation Project) 

(Presented in 2019 EPSA | 2021 Annual Conference of the American Association for Chinese Studies) [[`slides`](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/pcpb/main/slides/slides.pdf)][[`paper`](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/pcpb/main/paper/Mayors_and_Pork_Barrel.pdf)]

This paper examines the contribution of mayor’s political career within governments in obtaining more distributive benefits to her own municipality. Mayors with more sophisticated experience have stronger electoral ties to the central government, which is useful for them to enhance their chances of staying in office. Using panel dataset of Revenue Support Grant, we find that municipalities whose mayors with longer career spent in the legislature are more likely to be allocated higher fiscal expenditures. The effect is even stronger if the mayors have worked in legislative standing committees. On the contrary, mayors’ prior political career in ministries does not significantly help their municipalities obtain the grant. The findings suggest that compared to experience as a central government official, a legislative career has a leading impact on grant transfer to municipalities.
