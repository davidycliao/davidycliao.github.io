### ***“Title: Pork Barrel, Polarization and Competition within the Congress: The Applications of Computational Social Science”***  

<div style="text-align: center">Abstract<br/>

<div style="text-align: justify">
Estimating the politician positions of parties and politicians is key to understanding party polarization and electoral competition. This thesis quantitatively investigates how 2008 Taiwan electoral reform through single non-transferable voting (SNTV) to single-member districts system(SMDs) impacts the behavior of legislators and their electoral strategies, by analyzing roll calls and parliamentary questions. I aim to deliver several pieces of empirical evidence to revisit the following research questions: (1) Does the switch of the electoral system to SMDs mitigate political polarization among parties? (2) Does the reform influence the intra-party competition, and thus, change legislators’ policy positions? (3) Does the reform reduce re- gional particularism expressed in declared opinions, like in textual archives, but increase the promises of universalism policies? The thesis is expected to apply ideal point estimation and natural language processing techniques that are currently deployed by the forefront study of legislatures and strengthen the understanding of Taiwan party politics and party competition inside The Legislative Yuan. These potential findings can further help policymakers clarify possible outcomes of the electoral reform, shedding light on party competition and party polarization in modern democracies.

**Chapter 1: Mayors and Pork Barrel: Legislative Experience Bias in Intergovernmental Transfers to Taiwan Municipalities** [[`slides`](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/pcpb/main/slides/slides.pdf)][[`paper`](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/pcpb/main/paper/Mayors_and_Pork_Barrel.pdf)]

This paper examines the contribution of mayor’s political career within governments in obtaining more distributive benefits to her own municipality. Mayors with more sophisticated experience have stronger electoral ties to the central government, which is useful for them to enhance their chances of staying in office. Using panel dataset of Revenue Support Grant, we find that municipalities whose mayors with longer career spent in the legislature are more likely to be allocated higher fiscal expenditures. The effect is even stronger if the mayors have worked in legislative standing committees. On the contrary, mayors’ prior political career in ministries does not significantly help their municipalities obtain the grant. The findings suggest that compared to experience as a central government official, a legislative career has a leading impact on grant transfer to municipalities.

**Chapter 2: Electoral Reform and Disunited Polarization: Evidence from Legislative Roll Calls** [[`slides`](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/erdp/master/slides/slides.html#1)][[`paper`](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/erdp/master/paper/David-YCLIAO-POPE-Feb-24.pdf)] (with [<span style="color:#323434"> Li Tang, Middlesex University London and Univeristy of Essex</span>](https://sites.google.com/view/litang2020)) 

This article investigates the strategic (inter- and intra-) party positioning in response to an electoral system transition from single non-transferable vote (SNTV) to single-member districts (SMDs) by studying the electoral reform in Taiwan and pro- vides empirical evidence to the following questions. Does the switch of electoral system from SNTV to SMDs mitigate political polarization among parties? Does it influence the intra-party unitedness (cohesiveness), and thus, change legislators’ ideological positioning? To this end, we estimate individual legislator’s ideological positions from sessional roll call votes continuously covering ex-ante and ex-post periods of the reform, from 1992 to 2015. The preliminary finding suggests that in the electoral transition from SNTV to SMDs, ideological positions between two major parties are drastically polarized. In the meanwhile, this electoral transition significantly dis-unifies co-partisan legislators on the ideological spectrum. In addition, co-partisan legislators became ideologically distant (disunited) while opponents polarized themselves. These findings help clarify possible outcomes of the electoral reform from SNTV to SMDs, shedding light on party polarization and party competition in modern democracies.

**Chapter 3: When Speaking of *Pork*: Exploring Parliamentary Questions Using NLP Transformers**   [[`poster`](https://github.com/davidycliao/elp)] [[`code`](https://github.com/davidycliao/PorkCNN)]

In this article, I quantitatively investigate legislators' electoral strategies and communication style by applying an encoder-decoder-based models to measure pork-barrel features on the parliamentary questions proposed by the legislators from 1993 to 2020. To incorporate this application into our analysis, I have trained a deep learning classifier with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representative from Transformers) on the human-labelled pork-barrel legislation, including the bills and the amendments from Taiwan’s legislature (the Legislative Yuan). The collection of legislation are annotated with binary-instance classification by reading the text, devoted either to promoting the pork-barrel project (earmarked projects) or cultivating favoured minorities by providing subsidies. With attention mechanisms in transformers architecture, BERT model not only learns the condensed features of bag-of-words but also has better tokenization algorithms for handling unseen words. With the pork-barrel  features identified by the trained model, I find that legislators under SNTV (single non-transferable voting ) are likely to express political intension with regards to pork barrel projects in written parliamentary questions and seek personal votes by promising particularistic benefits to their targeted supporters. Consistent with the literature, switching from SNTV to Single-Member Districts decrease legislators' incentives to bring home the bacon but increases their attention to universalism (national) policies.

**Chapter 4: Measuring Party Cohesion on Parliamentary Question Keywords** 

([<span style="color:#323434"> Calvin, Yu-Ceng Liao, Post Doctoral Research Fellow at Taiwan Studies Center, National Chengchi University</span>](https://sites.google.com/view/calvin-yuceng-liao/home))

Understanding the positions of parties and legislators is key to conceptualizing party cohesion and their representation in most democracies. This study is to measure intra-party heterogeneity and variability in issue attention by looking at what and why legislators are more likely to oversight the ministry officials on one specific topic or another during the question time. We answer this question using the case of Taiwan Legislative Yuan, and data on written parliamentary questions through an electoral reform from 1993 to 2020. We estimate the position of each legislator on the left-right dimensions using the keywords extracted from the questions that legislators request for information on policies and activities of ministries from executive officials. We document how the electoral reform shapes legislators' ideological position and variability on their issue attentions: party cohesion increases when high variability in issue attention in Single Member District (SMD) and decreases when low variability under Single Non-transferable Vote (SNTV). These findings shed new light on providing a different approach to estimating party cohesion as well as to understanding the changes of political behaviour in representation and political accountability through the electoral reform.

**Factionalism and the Red Guards under Mao’s China: Ideal Point Estimation Using Text Data** 

(with Yi-Nung Tsai, National Chengchi University; Dechun Zhang, Leiden University) [[`code`](https://github.com/davidycliao/redguards)][[`slides`](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/redguards/master/slides/slides.pdf)][[`paper`]()] 

This article estimates the spatial positioning of the political elites and participants in the Cultural Revolution through analyzing expressed political views in propaganda publication in China. Prior theoretical research indicates that the political elites and the Red Guards lost control of the social movement, and it evolved into sheer verbal violence and physical skirmishes across all provinces in the end. We show that in this political chaos, the Red Guards and the elite were dynamically fractioned, as is reflected in self-printed propaganda, such as big-character posters (Dazibao 大字报) and tabloids (Xiaobao 小报). This paper also develops a novel approach that augments TextRank algorithm to extract keywords and Chinese phrases, on top of the Poisson scaling model (Wordfish) to estimate the differences of spatial positions using the extracted textual key terms. Results are shown to be consistent with the literature on the Cultural Revolution.

**Income Inequality, Party Misperception and Democracy Distrust** 

(with Royce Carroll, University of Essex; Li Tang, Middlesex University London and Univeristy of Essex; and Tzu-Ping Liu, University of Taipei)

This paper studies an important political channel, through which income inequality transforms into dissatisfaction with democracy and distrust towards government, using multiple waves of the British Election Study from 2015 to 2019. We first document that households of different wealth have persistent gaps in the degree of satisfaction with democracy and governmental trust, regardless of their gender, education, party affiliation, survey waves, etc. Low-income earners are more dissatisfied with how democracy works and more distrustful of the government than affluent households. Then we show that income inequality has causal effects on misperceptions about political parties, that is, the extent to which households wrongly placed their beliefs towards parties' left-right position from reality, measured by the British Election Study Expert Survey. Households of low income perceive party positions less accurately than households of affluence and, therefore, have more significant misperceptions. Finally, we verify the causality from the size of party misperception to dissatisfaction with democracy and distrust towards the government: observing the actual party positions, low-income households are more disapp ointed by the more significant discrepancy between th eir perceived and actual party position and become more dissatisfied and distrustful of the democracy and the government.

**This is What We Hope: Estimating Perceptions on Political Trust** 

(with Li Tang, Middlesex University London and Univeristy of Essex; Tzu-Ping Liu, University of Taipei)

We propose a new approach to estimating voters' preferences on party positions, including aggregate subjective targets of Conservative Party's and Labour Party's positions, based on their political confidence towards the government, that requires no priors on the underlying data-generating process of the targets. Our approach entails directly measuring voters' confidence from the self-reported public trust towards the Parliament surveyed by British Election Study during 2017 and 2019. This paper first documents robust evidence that voters with different partisan affiliations prefer parties to locate differently: when parties move closer to the targets, the corresponding representative voter gains satisfaction and trust in the Parliament. Then, we find the estimated targets persistently deviate from perceptions of experts from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey in varying degrees, regardless of personal attributes and party affiliations. Interestingly, low-income voters from Conservative Party have targets that are more prone to disagree with experts' perceptions than high-income voters. These findings shed new light on new approach to capturing voters' preference on party positions as well as discrepancy between actual party positions and voters' perception on political parties.
