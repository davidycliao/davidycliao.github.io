<!-- My research projects include: *my PhD dissertation on Taiwan's legislative politics*, *quantitative studies of party misplacement, political ideology and collective actions in parliarmentary democracies*, and *computational methods applied to study contemporary China*.  My works mainly uses quantitative text analysis and computational methods (including natural language processing, machine learning classification), to better understand how political elites position themselves through their political narratives, and how their narratives shape their political behaviors and change the mass’ attitudes and expectations towards future. These narratives naturally come from politicians’ speeches and debates, social media accounts and digitized historical records (such as posters during the Cultural Revolution). -->

<u>Electoral Reform and Fragmented Polarization: New Evidence from Taiwan Legislative Roll Call </u>

[[`pdf`](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/working-paper/main/Electoral_Reform_and_Fragmented_Polarisation.pdf) ｜ appendix] 

<div style="text-align: justify">
This paper investigates how legislators respond to electoral reform by adjusting their ideological positions with respect to co-partisans and rivals. Using data from Taiwan's legislative roll calls over 20 years, we study the extent to which partisan disagreement is influenced by the 2008 Taiwanese electoral reform  from Single Non-Transferable Votes to Single-Member Districts. Contrary to the literature, our empirical evidence documents that the reform significantly fragmented legislator positions in relation to both co-partisans and members from rival parties. Intra- and inter-party disagreement increased shortly after the reform. However, the effect of the reform diminishes over time. After 6 years, disagreement between mainstream parties returned to its pre-reform level.

<u>(Mis)perception of Party-voter Congruence and Satisfaction with Democracy</u> (with Royce Carroll, Essex; Li Tang, Middlesex University London) 

[[`pdf`](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/working-paper/main/_Mis_perception_of_Party_voter_Congruence_and_Satisfaction_with_Democracy.pdf) | appendix] 

<div style="text-align: justify">
This study examines the relationship between party-voter congruence and satisfaction with democracy, focusing on the impact of misperception of party positions. Using panel data from the British Election Study and cross-sectional data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, we find that misperception leads to a divergence between actual and perceived levels of party-voter incongruence, which can influence satisfaction with democracy. We show that perceived incongruence reduces satisfaction with democracy, while actual incongruence has no separate effect. These results suggest that biased perceptions of party positions can impact satisfaction with democracy, regardless of how well parties act as representatives of their voters. Our results underscore the importance of perceptions in shaping democratic satisfaction, highlighting the need to consider both objective and subjective measures of party-voter congruence when examining both its causes and effects.

<u>Electoral Reform and Pork Barrel in Parliamentary Questions</u> 

[[`pdf`]() | appendix] 

<div style="text-align: justify">
Measuring legislator behaviours and tendencies towards constituencies under different electoral systems is important. This paper quantitatively investigates this topic using the case of Taiwan Legislative Yuan and data on written parliamentary questions through an electoral reform from multi-member districts (MMD) to single-member districts (SMD). To answer the research questions, I train deep learning models on multi-convolutional neural networks with an embedding layer extracted from Transformer BERT to detect pork-barrel features in parliamentary questions over time. With Transformers' attention mechanisms, this combination approach enables the machine to learn the condensed features of embedding representation and better handle polysemous words than traditional embedding approaches like Word2Vec. Last, I employ regression analysis to test the impact of the reform occurrence and control for differences between districts and legislators through the transition. Evidence exists to show that the transition of electoral reform incurs essential changes in legislators' behaviour. Legislators under multi-member districts are more likely to express political intention regarding pork-barrel projects in the parliarmentary questions. The reform subsequently demonstrates heterogeneous effects on large parties vis-à-vis small parties.

<u>The Role of Rituals in Adversarial Parliaments: An Analysis of Expressions of Collegiality in the British House of Commons</u>  (with Thomas Saalfeld and David Beck, *R&R*)

<div style="text-align: justify">
Despite the adversarial character of debates in the British House of Commons, Members of Parliament (MPs) observe a highly ritualized rhetorical style emphasizing collegiality and mutual respect across party lines. The language MPs use in this context harks back to an ancient pre-democratic past. Why does a modern democratic legislature conceal partisan conflict by using pre-democratic ritualistic references to ‘the House’ as a corporate actor? Why do they call their fiercest competitors ‘honourable Members’ or even ‘Friends’? In this paper, we review the results of important empirical studies suggesting that the activities even of modern democratic parliaments (based on intense party competition) reveal traces of pre-democratic corporate bodies in some respects. Analyzing a large corpus of parliamentary speeches in the British House of Commons between 1988 and 2019, we propose a novel technique to identify and measure references to collegiality in Britain’s parliamentary system. Using a simple descriptive method, we demonstrate the extent to which such references vary systematically by party and across time, suggesting that they are used strategically in the stylized and ritualized language of parliamentary debate in the Commons depending on the status of MPs as members of government or oppositional parties.

<u>Factionalism and the Red Guards under Mao’s China: Ideal Point Estimation Using Text Data</u> (with Yi-Nung Tsai, National Chengchi University; Daniel Tene, Univeristy of Essex; Dechun Zhang, Leiden University)


<div style="text-align: justify">
In this paper, we design a new strain of text scaling method,  Swordfish  (Slogan-featured Wordfish), that takes advantage of the TextRank algorithm to extract the most representative political slogans in a given context and estimates Wordfish with those extracted text variables. We test this method using the case of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the historical archive of handwritten big-character posters and self-printed tabloids from 1966. We estimate student protests' ideal points by analyzing expressed political views in propaganda publications. Our findings point to evidence of factional re(de)alignments within the movement and demonstrate how the students from different educational backgrounds followed Mao Zedong and Xiaohongshu 小紅書 (Little Red Book) and then fell into armed conflicts that divided families, the classes and the society. The results estimated by Swordfish are shown to be consistent with the representative qualitative literature on factionalism during the Cultural Revolution. We also compare our results with 14 experts on the study of Chinese Communist Party history, and we find that our estimations are quite consistent with experts' judgement.

**2016 亦敵亦友:臺灣民眾 對中國印象的評價《社會科學論叢》23(1):63-105** （與吳重禮、楊和縉）


本文援引研究種族議題（或族群政治）兩個相互競逐的理論—「接觸理論」（contact theory）和「團體威脅論」（group threat theory）—作為研究架構，套用於臺灣和中國民眾的接觸經驗，檢證在兩岸人民交流互動益形密切之際，臺灣民眾對於中國的整體印象，是否會因為接觸頻繁而增進瞭解，提升好感？或者，因為接觸和溝通機會的增加，反而影響臺灣民眾對於中國印象產生負面觀感？作者擷取「2012年總統大選後國內民意對兩岸關係與大陸政策之觀點及變化」電話訪問資料，採取「因素分析」（factor analysis）將民眾對於中國大陸的好惡程度印象區分為「既定印象」、「政治印象」，以及「經濟印象」三個面向，並以「迴歸模型」（regression models）和「有序勝算對數模型」（ordered logit model）進行檢驗。本研究貢獻在於，透過實證結果顯示，在「既定印象」和「政治印象」方面，猶如研究預期，泛綠陣營支持者和本省籍選民對於中國抱持較為負面的觀感，其餘不同社會人口特徵的選民並無顯著差異；值得強調的是，在「經濟印象」方面，泛綠陣營支持者和獨立選民對於中國印象並沒有顯著差異。在結論中，本文摘述實證分析要點，並提出中國印象的研究意涵。

**2016 原民會主委的補助款？檢視「基本設施維護費」在原住民55個鄉、鎮、市、區分配的實證分析《台灣原住民族研究學報》 4(2):23-63**

誰從政治場域中獲得比較多的政策利益？或在政策過程中，能明確主導利益分配？是分配政治研究中時常被提出來討論的研究議題。有鑑於此，本文以分配政治的實證研究為理論基礎，分析專責原住民族公共事務的中央行政機關－「行政院原住民族委員會」－補助全國55 個平地與山地原住民鄉、區、鎮、市的「基本設施維持費」，檢視由原住民委員會補助偏鄉經濟發展的政策方案是否會受到政治、族群（平地或山地身分別）、或族別因素所影響？綜合實證分析結果，在控制若干影響因素後，總統選舉得票表現較為脆弱的鄉、鎮、市、區，所獲得補助金額比例明顯高於其他原住民地區。換言之，基本設施維持經費對於中央行政部門來說，不僅是一種調節地方財政發展的政策工具，同時能幫助總統攏絡對手陣營支持者、擴大選票支持的手段。在後續的結論中，本文摘述實證分析要點，並提出影響政策利益分配的研究意涵。

**2015 The Rationale for Supporting Nuclear Power: Analysis of Taiwanese Public Opinion Survey _International Relations ofthe Asia-Pacific_ 15 (1): 147-176**（Su, Xiaochen, Chung-li Wu, Yen-chieh Liao, Tai-De Lee, and Chen Tsao)

The future of nuclear energy use has become increasingly contentious across the world. This is especially the case in Taiwan, which simultaneously suffers from the instabilities associated with fossil fuel imports and widespread public doubts about the government's ability to handle a Fukushima-scale disaster, while also being increasingly dependent on nuclear energy. This study employs the 2013 Taiwan Election and Democratization Study (TEDS) survey on the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant to gauge public opinion on the nuclear issue. The results demonstrate that while the public tends to be pro-nuclear when they are informed about the financial consequences of abandoning nuclear power and reassured about safety concerns, opponents of nuclear power, though numerically fewer, tend to be more vocal. Further research is needed to determine the exact logic of the public's decision making, based on a more precise set of preconditions.

**2014 原住民議員與補助款的分配 誰比較多？誰又比較少？為什麼？《台灣原住民族研究學報》 4卷2期: 27-45**

在國內，分配政治研究將進發展了近十年，累積相當多的實證研究的基礎，不過以原住民籍民意代表為觀察對象或針對原鄉補助款分配為議題的研究卻付之闕如。鑑此，本文使用臺東縣政府所公布95年度-100年度「議員建議補（捐）助案件」的補助款資料，以「分配政治研究」過去所關心的數項問題應用在台灣原住民的代議制度，並系統性地比較平地原住民議員與山地原住民議員的分配政治行為。從整體的研究結果來說，政黨、資深程度與委員會召集委員等制度性因素對於原住民議員爭取建議案的影響效果不是相當明顯，但諸多選舉因素仍左右原住民議員爭取超額的補助款，而這也意味著原住民議員的利益分配型態與過去一般分配研究存有顯著地差異性。
