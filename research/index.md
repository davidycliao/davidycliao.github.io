**Chapter 1: Electoral Reform and Disunited Polarization: Evidence from Legislative Roll Calls**

The extent to which electoral systems change legislative preference and representation remains debatable. This paper investigates how parties and legislators strategically position themselves in response to an institutional change using the case of Taiwan's electoral reform through the Single Non-transferable Vote (SNTV) to the Single-Member Districts (SMD). To this end, I apply dynamic ideal point estimation to measure legislators' ideological preferences and study whether the reform moderates the level of intra-party disagreement induced by the change in the systems. The empirical evidence shows that intra-party fractionalization increases while ideological differences between major parties are drastically polarized in the SMD. Controlling for yearly effects during the presence of the reform, however, I find the impact of party division decreases as time goes by. This paper complements mounting evidence that electoral systems play an important role in explaining lawmakers' preferences and the changes in ideological positioning shedding light on party polarization and party competition in modern democracies.

**Chapter 2: Electoral Reform and Pork Barrel in Parliamentary Questions** 

Measuring legislator behaviours and tendencies towards constituencies under the different systems is important. This paper quantitatively investigates 
the topic using Taiwan Legislative Yuan's case and data on written parliamentary questions through an electoral reform 
from multi-member districts (MMD) to single-member districts (SMD). With existing labelled pork legislation, I 
train a deep learning model to measure pork-barrel features on parliamentary questions. Evidence exists to show that legislators under 
MMD are more likely to express political intention about pork-barrel projects in written parliamentary questions. Yet, the reform subsequently demonstrates heterogeneous effects on major parties vis-à-vis minority parties.

**Chapter 3: Measuring Party Cohesion on Parliamentary Question Keywords** ([<span style="color:#778899"> co-authored with Calvin Yu-Ceng Liao, Post Doctoral Research Fellow at Taiwan Studies Center, National Chengchi University</span>](https://sites.google.com/view/calvin-yuceng-liao/home))

Understanding the positions of parties and legislators is key to conceptualizing party cohesion and their representation in most democracies. This study is to measure intra-party heterogeneity and variability in issue attention by looking at what and why legislators are more likely to oversight the ministry officials on one specific topic or another during the question time. We answer this question using the case of Taiwan Legislative Yuan, and data on written parliamentary questions through an electoral reform from 1993 to 2020. We estimate the position of each legislator on the left-right dimensions using the keywords extracted from the questions that legislators request for information on policies and activities of ministries from executive officials. We document how the electoral reform shapes legislators' ideological position and variability on their issue attentions: party cohesion increases when high variability in issue attention in Single Member District (SMD) and decreases when low variability under Single Non-transferable Vote (SNTV). These findings shed new light on providing a different approach to estimating party cohesion as well as to understanding the changes of political behaviour in representation and political accountability through the electoral reform.

**Chapter 4: Mayors and Pork Barrel: Legislative Experience Bias in Intergovernmental Transfers to Taiwan Municipalities**

This paper examines the contribution of mayor’s political career within governments in obtaining more distributive benefits to her own municipality. Mayors with more sophisticated experience have stronger electoral ties to the central government, which is useful for them to enhance their chances of staying in office. Using panel dataset of Revenue Support Grant, we find that municipalities whose mayors with longer career spent in the legislature are more likely to be allocated higher fiscal expenditures. The effect is even stronger if the mayors have worked in legislative standing committees. On the contrary, mayors’ prior political career in ministries does not significantly help their municipalities obtain the grant. The findings suggest that compared to experience as a central government official, a legislative career has a leading impact on grant transfer to municipalities.

**Factionalism and the Red Guards under Mao’s China: Ideal Point Estimation Using Text Data** (with Yi-Nung Tsai, National Chengchi University; Daniel Tene, Univeristy of Essex;  Dechun Zhang, Leiden University )

In this paper, we design a new strain of text scaling method, Swordfish (__Slogan-featured Wordfish__), that takes advantage of the TextRank 
algorithm to extract the most representative political slogans in a given context and estimates _Wordfish_ with those extracted text variables. We test this method using the case of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the historical archive of handwritten big-character posters and self-printed tabloids from 1966. We estimate student protests' ideal points by analyzing expressed political views in propaganda publications. Our findings point to evidence of factional re(de)alignments within the movement and demonstrate how the students from different educational backgrounds followed Mao Zedong and Xiaohongshu 小紅書 (Little Red Book) and then fell into armed conflicts that divided families, the classes and the society. The results estimated by our approach are shown to be consistent with the representative qualitative literature of factionalism regarding the Cultural Revolution.</div>

**State-led Nationalism: Measuring China’s Online Nationalists on Weibo** (with [<span style="color:#778899"> Dechun Zhang, Leiden University</span>](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/dechun-zhang#tab-1))

Measuring Chinese nationalism on social media is essential to understand the operation of propaganda strategies used by
the government to advance advertisements in its legitimacy and governance in China. 
This research note follows the literature on Chinese nationalism and operationalizes major nationalistic 
concepts commonly found in Sina Weibo (China's most popular social media platform). 
We introduce a machine classifier that identify nationalistic attributes and its probability of being categorized as an attitude of belligerent nationalism on Weibo. 
We train our model using comments and posts from China's state-controlled media, *People's Daily*, on more than one million spanning 
different political incidents through 2018 to 2022. The training source consists of 13,200 Weibo comments, 4,871 nationalistic comments and 8,329 non-nationalistic comments, respectively. 
With CNN trained on top of the BERT layer, the model performance achieves 91\% in F1-Score and 92\% in the weighted average, respectively. 
Recommendations are also included on applying our machine classifier to related textual sources for future research on Chinese politics.

**Party Misperception, Party-voter Incongruence and Political Distrust** (with Li Tang, Middlesex University London and Univeristy of Essex)

To what extent do misperceptions of party positions affect voters' perception of representation and satisfaction with democracy? This paper offers an explanation using the case of the UK and data from the British Election Survey (BES) and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES). We show that voters' perceptional gaps in understanding party positions contribute to political incongruence between party and voters, subsequently deteriorating their trust and satisfaction with government. From our analysis, the misperceptions about UK parties increase both perceived and actual incongruence between voters and parties, with those with higher perceptional gaps demonstrating higher party–voter incongruence. This perceptional gap further contributes to citizen distrust and dissatisfaction towards the political system.

**This is What We Hope: Estimating Perceptions on Political Trust** (with Li Tang, Middlesex University London and Univeristy of Essex)

We propose a new approach to estimating voters' preferences on party positions, including aggregate subjective targets of Conservative Party's and Labour Party's positions, based on their political confidence towards the government, that requires no priors on the underlying data-generating process of the targets. Our approach entails directly measuring voters' confidence from the self-reported public trust towards the Parliament surveyed by British Election Study during 2017 and 2019. This paper first documents robust evidence that voters with different partisan affiliations prefer parties to locate differently: when parties move closer to the targets, the corresponding representative voter gains satisfaction and trust in the Parliament. Then, we find the estimated targets persistently deviate from perceptions of experts from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey in varying degrees, regardless of personal attributes and party affiliations. Interestingly, low-income voters from Conservative Party have targets that are more prone to disagree with experts' perceptions than high-income voters. These findings shed new light on new approach to capturing voters' preference on party positions as well as discrepancy between actual party positions and voters' perception on political parties.

**Estimating Heterogeneity Preference in the United Nations with Voting Records and Their Debates** (with Winnie Xia, University of Essex)

Analyzing the preference of the United Nations is essential to understanding the origin of conflicts within major international organizations. This paper examines when and why members of the United Nations express their preferences consistently in both voting and speeches while some members do not. We answer this question using the subject of international security discussed and voted on by the representative of the states during the United Nations Security Council between 1980 and 2021. We parallelly estimate state ideal points on a left-right dimension using both the general debates and voting records with regards to topics on international security across time. Finally, we show how the state's voting preference correlates with their speech ideal points while some of them do not: heterogeneity between their speeches and voting decreases when political competitions at home increase.

**官僚團體如何「重寫」意識形態陳述：以《人民日報》習近平思想的評論為例** (與蔡儀儂)

意識形態體系在維繫中共政權的執政穩定，長期扮演了重要角色。雖然部分觀察透過分析中共制定意識形態的過程，指出官定的意識形態非鐵板一塊，而是黨內政治衝突的折衷結果。
不過，類似研究卻較少觸及意識形態建構完成後，黨內的官僚團體，如何透過各自的話語體系，將意識形態「改寫」成符合其利益偏好的政治陳述。在本文，我們以《人民日報》習近平思想的報刊評論為例，
並根據Tsai與Kao（2013）發展的「寫作組」概念，在資料蒐集過程根據評論的主題與作者，標記其所屬官僚團體。
在分析策略上，我們使用使用自動摘要生成技術（Automatic Text Summarization）的TextRank演算法，萃取文本的關鍵詞建立主題模型（topic model）。
研究發現，我們認為這些討論習近平思想的評論，會依據不同主題與作者，在關鍵詞的使用存在差異，這反映其代表官僚團體，透過差異性的話語敘事，標示其政治立場。
整體而言，我們的研究呈示了官僚團體，透過意識形態「包裝」其利益表達的陳述政治（discourse politics）。

**2016 原民會主委的補助款？檢視「基本設施維護費」在原住民55個鄉、鎮、市、區分配的實證分析《台灣原住民族研究學報》 4(2):23-63**

誰從政治場域中獲得比較多的政策利益？或在政策過程中，能明確主導利益分配？是分配政治研究中時常被提出來討論的研究議題。有鑑於此，本文以分配政治的實證研究為理論基礎，分析專責原住民族公共事務的中央行政機關－「行政院原住民族委員會」－補助全國55 個平地與山地原住民鄉、區、鎮、市的「基本設施維持費」，檢視由原住民委員會補助偏鄉經濟發展的政策方案是否會受到政治、族群（平地或山地身分別）、或族別因素所影響？綜合實證分析結果，在控制若干影響因素後，總統選舉得票表現較為脆弱的鄉、鎮、市、區，所獲得補助金額比例明顯高於其他原住民地區。換言之，基本設施維持經費對於中央行政部門來說，不僅是一種調節地方財政發展的政策工具，同時能幫助總統攏絡對手陣營支持者、擴大選票支持的手段。在後續的結論中，本文摘述實證分析要點，並提出影響政策利益分配的研究意涵。

**2015 The Rationale for Supporting Nuclear Power: Analysis of Taiwanese Public Opinion Survey _International Relations ofthe Asia-Pacific_ 15 (1): 147-176**（Su, Xiaochen, Chung-li Wu, Yen-chieh Liao, Tai-De Lee, and Chen Tsao

The future of nuclear energy use has become increasingly contentious across the world. This is especially the case in Taiwan, which simultaneously suffers from the instabilities associated with fossil fuel imports and widespread public doubts about the government's ability to handle a Fukushima-scale disaster, while also being increasingly dependent on nuclear energy. This study employs the 2013 Taiwan Election and Democratization Study (TEDS) survey on the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant to gauge public opinion on the nuclear issue. The results demonstrate that while the public tends to be pro-nuclear when they are informed about the financial consequences of abandoning nuclear power and reassured about safety concerns, opponents of nuclear power, though numerically fewer, tend to be more vocal. Further research is needed to determine the exact logic of the public's decision making, based on a more precise set of preconditions.

**2014 原住民議員與補助款的分配 誰比較多？誰又比較少？為什麼？《台灣原住民族研究學報》 4卷2期: 27-45**

在國內，分配政治研究將進發展了近十年，累積相當多的實證研究的基礎，不過以原住民籍民意代表為觀察對象或針對原鄉補助款分配為議題的研究卻付之闕如。鑑此，本文使用臺東縣政府所公布95年度-100年度「議員建議補（捐）助案件」的補助款資料，以「分配政治研究」過去所關心的數項問題應用在台灣原住民的代議制度，並系統性地比較平地原住民議員與山地原住民議員的分配政治行為。從整體的研究結果來說，政黨、資深程度與委員會召集委員等制度性因素對於原住民議員爭取建議案的影響效果不是相當明顯，但諸多選舉因素仍左右原住民議員爭取超額的補助款，而這也意味著原住民議員的利益分配型態與過去一般分配研究存有顯著地差異性。
