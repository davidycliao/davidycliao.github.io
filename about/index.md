<div style="text-align: justify">


My name is David (Yen-Chieh) Liao. I am a PhD Candidate in the University of Essex Department of Government and a researcher of [<span style="color:#323434">*Legislators between Accountability and Collective Agency (LACAN)*</span>](https://projectlacan.wordpress.com/team/) at the Chair of Comparative Politics in the University of Bamberg.  I have a BA and a MA in Public Administration & Policy from National Taipei University in Taiwan.


<br/>

I study <span style="color:#323434"> **distributive politics**</span>, <span style="color:#323434"> **roll call polarization**</span> and <span style="color:#323434"> **legislative politics**</span>  with a focus on  Taiwan's legislature (the Legislative Yuan). Specifically, I am interested in how electoral motives shape preference, representation and ideological positionings. For my dissertation, I use ideal point estimation and computational methods to evaluate  the impact of the electoral reform on legislators' representation and behaviour, hence decreasing or increasing incentives to pay attention to pork-barrel programmes. 

<br/>

Apart from my dissertation, I am interested in applying various natural language processing techniques to study European parliamentary speeches, social media data (Twitter and Weibo), political discourse during the Cultural Revolution and accommodate a deep learning approach to measure internal conflict and inter-party divisions from facial and vocal expressions of the legislators in the US context.
