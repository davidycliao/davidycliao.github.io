I am a Research Fellow in Natural Language Processing at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government (CAIG) and an Affiliate Fellow at the Institute for Data and AI at the University of Birmingham. In 2021-2022, I was a predoctoral research fellow at the Chair of Comparative Politics at Universität Bamberg, and subsequently served as a postdoctoral researcher at University College Dublin in 2023.

<!-- I received my Ph.D. in Politics from the University of Essex in 2023, specializing in legislative behavior and comparative political institutions with particular focus on Taiwan and East Asian contexts. Additionally, I completed both my BA and MA in Public Administration and Policy at National Taipei University.

My research has been published in outlets including _Legislative Studies Quarterly_, _Political Science Research and Methods_, and _Electoral Studies_. Methodologically, my work combines traditional scaling methods from political science with contemporary NLP techniques, applying these integrated approaches to questions of representation and legislative behavior in East Asian democracies. 

Currently, I am working on multi-agent systems with large language models for synthetic survey experiments and simulating political deliberation among political elites. -->

I received my PhD in Politics from Essex (2023), and both my BA and MA in Public Administration and Policy from National Taipei University. My substantial work concentrates on legislative behavior and comparative political institutions, with particular focus on Taiwan and East Asian contexts.

Methodologically, I am especially interested in measuring ideological preferences and political stances using quantitative and computational methods, including the quantitative measurement of legislative voting, surveys, and political texts.

Embiyax su hug！哈囉！

非常歡迎來到我的個人網頁！

我是廖彥傑，來自靠近太魯閣國家公園的秀林部落（花蓮）。目前我在英國伯明罕大學人工智慧與政府研究中心及資料與人工智慧研究所擔任研究員，專注於生成式人工智慧在政治學、公共行政與公共政策領域的應用。
我畢業於國立臺北大學公共行政暨政策學系（學士與碩士），並於2023年取得英國艾塞克斯大學政治學博士學位。碩士期間，我的研究聚焦於台灣分配政策（肉桶政治）與原住民族群政治，特別關注大族與小族間的政治利益分配；博士論文則延伸探討選舉制度改革對立法行為的影響。

2024年加入伯明罕大學後，我開始運用人工智慧與自然語言處理技術進行政治學與公共政策分析。除了持續測量政治菁英的偏好、立場與意識型態，我目前的研究重點是透過量化與計算方法（如立法投票的理想點估計、調查數據與政治文本分析）測量意識型態偏好，並將這些方法擴展至多智能體大型語言模型系統，應用於：(1) 計算調查實驗、(2) 模擬政治菁英審議過程、(3) 測量人工智慧系統的政治取向與意識型態差異。

我主要活躍於英格蘭的科爾切斯特、倫敦與伯明罕三地，每年也會固定參加台灣東吳大學國會研討會，以及 EPSS（ex EPSA）、APSA 等國際會議。如果您也參加這些會議，歡迎隨時約喝杯咖啡或啤酒！
