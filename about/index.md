<div style="text-align: justify">

I am a Research Fellow in Natural Language Processing at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government (CAIG) and an Affiliate Fellow at the Institute for Data and AI at the University of Birmingham. Prior to this, I was a predoctoral research fellow at the Chair of Comparative Politics at Universität Bamberg (2021-2022), and subsequently served as a postdoctoral researcher at University College Dublin (2023).

I received my PhD in Politics from Essex (2023), and both my BA and MA in Public Administration and Policy from National Taipei University. My substantive work focuses on legislative behavior and comparative political institutions, with particular emphasis on Taiwan and East Asian contexts. Methodologically, I apply quantitative and computational approaches to measure ideological preferences and political stances of political elites. My research uses ideal point estimation from legislative voting, survey data analysis, and computational text analysis to understand how elites position themselves through their narratives and voting behavior and how this positioning shapes legislative behavior and public attitudes.

At Birmingham, I work with <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centres-institutes/centre-for-artificial-intelligence-in-government" style="color:#778899; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">CAIG</a> and <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centres-institutes/data-and-ai" style="color:#778899; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">the Institute for Data and AI</a> to implement multi-agent large language model systems for political science research, focusing on: (1) AI respondent survey experiments, (2) simulating political deliberation among elites, and (3) measuring the political orientations and ideological variations of AI systems themselves.

<!-- Since joining Birmingham in 2024, I have extended these measurement approaches to multi-agent large language model systems. My current research interest focuses on multi-agent large language model system applications in political science.

Embiyax su hug！哈囉！

非常歡迎來到我的個人網頁！

我是廖彥傑，來自花蓮秀林部落（靠近太魯閣國家公園）。目前在英國伯明罕大學人工智慧與政府研究中心及資料與人工智慧研究所擔任研究員，專注於生成式人工智慧在政治學、公共行政與公共政策領域的應用。

我畢業於國立臺北大學公共行政暨政策學系（學士與碩士），並於2023年取得英國艾塞克斯大學政治學博士學位。碩士期間，我的研究聚焦於台灣分配政策（肉桶政治）與原住民族群政治，特別關注大族與小族間的政治資源分配；博士論文則延伸探討選舉制度改革如何影響立法行為。

2024年加入伯明罕大學後，我開始運用人工智慧與自然語言處理技術進行政治學與公共政策分析。在持續測量政治菁英的偏好、立場與意識型態的基礎上，我透過量化與計算方法（如立法投票的理想點估計、調查數據分析與政治文本分析）建立測量框架，並將這些方法延伸至多智能體大型語言模型系統的應用，包括：(1) 大語言模型智能體在計算調查實驗的應用；(2) 智能體模擬政治菁英的審議過程 ；(3) 利用多智能體系統測量人工智慧的政治取向與意識型態差異。

我主要活躍於英格蘭的Colchester、倫敦與伯明罕三地。每年固定參加台灣東吳大學國會研討會，以及 PolMeth Europe、PolMeth、EPSS、APSA 等國際會議。如果您也參加這些會議，或剛好在這幾個城市，歡迎隨時相約喝杯咖啡或啤酒！
