My name is David (Yen-Chieh) Liao. I am a PhD Candidate in the University of Essex Department of Government and a researcher of [<span style="color:#778899">***Legislators between Accountability and Collective Agency (LACAN)***</span>](https://projectlacan.wordpress.com/team/) at the Chair of Comparative Politics, University of Bamberg in Germany. 


<br/>

I study *distributive politics*, *roll call polarization* and *legislative oversight*, with a focus on Taiwan Legislative Yuan (the Legislature). For my PhD dissertation project, I use ideal point estimation and computational methods to study the impact of the electoral reform in Taiwan and investigate how the reform shapes legislators' representation.
Specifically, I am interested in how electoral motives shape legislators' pork-barrel behaviour, ideological positioning and preference.


<br/>

Apart from my dissertation, I am interested in applying various natural language processing techniques to analyze European parliamentary speeches, social media text (Twitter and Weibo) and the Cultural Revolution publications (big-character posters), as well as using deep learning methods to measure internal conflict and inter-party divisions from facial and vocal expressions of the legislators in the US context.
