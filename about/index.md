My name is David (Yen-Chieh) Liao. I am PhD Candidate funded by Taiwan Ministry of Education (Jul 2017 - Aug 2021) at Department of Government in University of Essex and Predoctoral Researcher (Dec 2021-)  of [<span style="color:#778899">**Legislators between Accountability and Collective Agency (LACAN)**</span>](https://projectlacan.wordpress.com/team/) at the Chair of Comparative Politics in University of Bamberg.  


<br/>

I study __distributive politics__, __roll call polarization__ and __legislative oversight__, with a main focus on Taiwan Legislative Yuan (the Legislature). For my PhD dissertation project, I use ideal point estimation and computational methods to study the impact of the electoral reform in Taiwan and investigate how the reform shapes legislators' representation.
Specifically, I am interested in how electoral motives shape legislators' pork-barrel behaviour, ideological positionings and preferences. This dissertation project is awarded 2021 Taiwanese Overseas Pioneers Grants by Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology (July 2021 - August 2022).


<br/>

Apart from my dissertation, I am interested in applying various computational methods to estimate European party competition and communication strategies. Currently, 
I am looking at utilising the pre-trained models and *the transformer* to measure intra-party divisions via legislators' facial expressions and vocal dimensions, 
and start research papers about propaganda strategy in Contemporary China.
