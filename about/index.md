 My name is Yen-Chieh (David) Liao. I am an NLP Research Fellow working on Generative AI applications in political science at <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gov/liao-yen-chieh" style="color:#778899; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">the Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government (CAIG)</a>, and an Affiliate Fellow at <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centres-institutes-data-and-ai" style="color:#778899; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">the Institute for Data and AI</a> at the University of Birmingham.

I received my PhD in Politics from the University of Essex (2023), and both my BA and MA in Public Administration from National Taipei University. My substantial research focuses on legislative behavior and comparative political institutions, with particular emphasis on the contexts of Taiwan and East Asia. 

Methodologically, I am especially interested in measuring ideological preferences and political stances using quantitative and computational methods, including the analysis of legislative voting, surveys, and political texts.

Recently, I have been working with <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gov/liao-yen-chieh" style="color:#778899; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">our center</a> to implement multi-agent systems with large language models for survey experiments and simulating political deliberation among political elites.

<!-- Before joining Birmingham, I was a postdoctoral researcher at `<a href="" style="color: #778899; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">`UCD NEXSYS `</a>`, working under `<a href="" style="color: #778899; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">`Prof. Stefan MÃ¼ller `</a>` from `<a href="https://www.ucd.ie/spire/" style="color: #778899; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">`the School of Politics and International Relations `</a>` at University College Dublin. Previously, I served as a pre-doctoral fellow at `<a href="https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/comparpol/faculty-and-staff/thomas-saalfeld/" style="color: #778899; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">`the Chair of Comparative Politics `</a>`, University of Bamberg, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Thomas Saalfeld. -->

<!-- I received my PhD in Politics from the University of Essex in 2023, with my research focusing on Taiwan's electoral reform, pork barrel politics, and municipal politics using ideal point estimation and NLP methods. My PhD dissertation was supervised by `<a href="https://amatsuo.net" style="color: #778899; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">`Akitaka Matsuo`</a>`, `<a href="https://nicolebaerg.com" style="color: #778899; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">`Nicole Baerg`</a>`, and `<a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/CARRO40801/Royce-Carroll" style="color: #778899; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">`Royce Carroll`</a>`. My studies were supported by the Legislative Studies and Comparative Politics Scholarship from Taiwan's Ministry of Education (2017-2022) and the Taiwan TOP Research Grant (2022-2023). Prior to my PhD, I obtained my BA and MA in Public Administration & Policy from National Taipei University in Taiwan. -->


 <!-- My `<a href="https://davidycliao.github.io/research/" style="color: #778899; text-decoration: underline;">`recent work`</a>` involves quantitative text analysis and computational methods to better understand elite political behavior and its impact on citizen preferences, public attitudes, and future expectations. -->
