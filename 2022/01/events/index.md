### Presentation Ⅰ: Electoral Reform and Disunited Polarization: Evidence from Legislative Roll Calls

This article investigates the strategic (inter- and intra-) party positioning in response to an electoral system transition from single non-transferable vote (SNTV) to single-member districts (SMDs) by studying the electoral reform in Taiwan and pro- vides empirical evidence to the following questions. Does the switch of electoral system from SNTV to SMDs mitigate political polarization among parties? Does it influence the intra-party unitedness (cohesiveness), and thus, change legislators’ ideological positioning? To this end, we estimate individual legislator’s ideological positions from sessional roll call votes continuously covering ex-ante and ex-post periods of the reform, from 1992 to 2015. The preliminary finding suggests that in the electoral transition from SNTV to SMDs, ideological positions between two major parties are drastically polarized. In the meanwhile, this electoral transition significantly dis-unifies co-partisan legislators on the ideological spectrum. In addition, co-partisan legislators became ideologically distant (disunited) while opponents polarized themselves. These findings help clarify possible outcomes of the electoral reform from SNTV to SMDs, shedding light on party polarization and party competition in modern democracies.

### Presentation ⅠⅠ: Income Inequality, Party Misperception and Democracy Distrust 

(with Royce Carroll, University of Essex; Li Tang, Middlesex University London and Univeristy of Essex; Tzu-Ping Liu, University of Taipei)

This paper studies an important political channel, through which income inequality transforms into dissatisfaction with democracy and distrust towards government, using multiple waves of the British Election Study from 2015 to 2019. We first document that households of different wealth have persistent gaps in the degree of satisfaction with democracy and governmental trust, regardless of their gender, education, party affiliation, survey waves, etc. Low-income earners are more dissatisfied with how democracy works and more distrustful of the government than affluent households. Then we show that income inequality has causal effects on misperceptions about political parties, that is, the extent to which households wrongly placed their beliefs towards parties' left-right position from reality, measured by the British Election Study Expert Survey. Households of low income perceive party positions less accurately than households of affluence and, therefore, have more significant misperceptions. Finally, we verify the causality from the size of party misperception to dissatisfaction with democracy and distrust towards the government: observing the actual party positions, low-income households are more disapp ointed by the more significant discrepancy between th eir perceived and actual party position and become more dissatisfied and distrustful of the democracy and the government.
