### Factionalism and the Red Guards under Mao's China: Ideal Point Estimation Using Text Data

This article estimates student participants' ideal points  during the Cultural Revolution through analyzing expressed political views in propaganda publication. In this paper, we design a new strain of text scaling method as we called Slogan-based Wordfish (Sworfish) that takes advantage of the facilitation of the TextRank algorithm to extract the most representative major noun phrases, and estimates Bayesian Generalized Wordfish with those extracted text variables. Our findings point to evidence of re(de)alignments within the factions and demonstrate how the students from different areas follow Mao Zedong and Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book) then fall into a fratricidal conflict that divided families, the classes and the society.
how student participants were dynamically divided into multiple factions that  fought for controls the movement across times. The results estimated by our estimation approach are shown to be consistent with the important works of factionalism emerging in the Cultural Revolution.

### Electoral Reform and Pork Barrel in Parliamentary Questions

Measuring legislator behaviours and tendencies towards constituencies under different electoral systems is important. This paper quantitatively investigates this topic using the case of  Taiwan Legislative Yuan and data on written parliamentary questions through an electoral reform from multi-member districts (MMD) to single-member districts (SMD). With existing labelled pork legislation, I train deep learning models using convolutional neural networks with an embedding layer extracted from Transformer BERT to detect pork-barrel features in parliamentary questions over time. Evidence exists to show that legislators under MMD are more likely to express political intention about pork-barrel projects in written parliamentary questions. The reform subsequently demonstrates heterogeneous effects on major parties vis-à-vis minority parties, respectively.
