    <description><![CDATA[co-authored with Calvin Yu-Ceng Liao (Post Doctoral Research Fellow at Taiwan Studies Center, National Chengchi University)
Understanding the positions of parties and legislators is key to conceptualizing party cohesion and their representation in most democracies. This study is to measure intra-party heterogeneity and variability in issue attentions by looking at what and why legislators are more likely to oversight the ministry officials on one specific topic or another during the question time.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Electoral Reform and Pork Barrel in Parliamentary Questions Measuring legislator behaviours and tendencies towards constituencies under different electoral systems is important. This paper quantitatively investigates this topic using the case of Taiwan Legislative Yuan and data on written parliamentary questions through an electoral reform from multi-member districts (MMD) to single-member districts (SMD). With existing labelled pork legislation, I train deep learning models using convolutional neural networks with an embedding layer extracted from Transformer BERT to detect pork-barrel features in parliamentary questions over time.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In this paper, we design a new strain of text scaling method, Swordfish (Slogan-featured Wordfish), that takes advantage of the TextRank algorithm to extract the most representative political slogans in a given context and estimates Wordfish with those extracted text variables. We test this method using the case of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the historical archive of handwritten big-character posters and self-printed tabloids from 1966. We estimate student protests&rsquo; ideal points by analyzing expressed political views in propaganda publications.]]></description>
