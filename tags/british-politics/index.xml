    <description><![CDATA[Electoral Reform and Disunited Polarization: Evidence from Legislative Roll Calls This article investigates the strategic (inter- and intra-) party positioning in response to an electoral system transition from single non-transferable vote (SNTV) to single-member districts (SMDs) by studying the electoral reform in Taiwan and provides empirical evidence to the following questions. Does the switch of electoral system from SNTV to SMDs mitigate political polarization among parties? Does it influence the intra-party unitedness (cohesiveness), and thus, change legislatorsâ€™ ideological positioning?]]></description>

At the same time, modern democratic parliaments are usually analyzed as institutional arenas for the competition between political parties as hierarchical organizations. In this paper, we review the results of important empirical studies suggesting that the activity even of democratic parliaments shows signs of collective agency in some respects.

    <description><![CDATA[The paper investigates how citizens&rsquo; misperception of party positions influences the perceived congruence between ideological preferences and positions of parties&rsquo; ideological position. We use a voter-level longitudinal data in the British Election Study in conjunction with data from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES). We take advantage of the panel structure of our data set and directly test two hypotheses relating to voters&rsquo; misperception of party positions relates to subjectively perceived incongruence, and the effect of perceived and actual incongruence on trust and satisfaction with politics.]]></description>
