# Creating and Reproducing Collective Agency in the British House of Commons: A Text-Based Approach to Conceptualisation and Measurement


<div style="text-align: justify">


Parliaments carry many characteristics of collective actors, especially in relation to their historical constitutional struggles. At the same time, modern democratic parliaments are usually analyzed as institutional arenas for the competition between political parties as hierarchical organizations. In this paper, we review the results of important empirical studies suggesting that the activity even of democratic parliaments shows signs of collective agency in some respects. Analyzing a large text corpus of parliamentary speeches in the British House of Commons between 1988 and 2019, we develop a novel technique to identify and measure references to collective agency in parliamentary speeches directly. Using a simple descriptive method, we demonstrate the extent to which references to collective agency and collegiality vary systematically by party and across time, suggesting that the stylized and ritualized language of parliamentary debate in the Commons is used strategically depending on the status of MPs as members of a government or oppositional party.
