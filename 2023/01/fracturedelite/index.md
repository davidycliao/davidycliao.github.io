We design a deep-learning architecture to quantitatively estimate the ideological positions of political elites and analyze how the elites strategically respond to the mass rallies of Red Guards across time. Yet, numerous studies have drawn attention to fractured and polarizing trends in elites' ideologies, such the literature less empirically analyzes elites' public speeches to substantiate the claim. In this paper, we train machine learning algorithms using the red guard publications and their factional features to measure the elites' preferences based on public speeches during student rallies. The analysis shows that the deep learning framework can effectively predict their preference towards one faction or another and captures the varying nature of the elites' positioning as the campaign proceeds. The finding derived from our estimation strategy is consistent with the observation of the qualitative literature that the factional ties were weak and unstable during the Cultural Revolution.
