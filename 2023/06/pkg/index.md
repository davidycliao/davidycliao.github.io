# flairR: An R Wrapper for Accessing Flair NLP Tagging Features


## FlaiR - R wrapper for Flair NLP

<div style="text-align: justify">


We are testing our package, an R wrapper specifically designed for Flair NLP. This package offers core sequence tagging features such as __part-of-speech tasks__, __named entity recognition__, and __transformer-based sentiment analysis__. For researchers in social or political science, it directly returns a dataframe instead of objects. If you are more comfortable with function-oriented features, this R wrapper might be beneficial for you, as it provides a more direct approach. Feel free to fork our repository, submit pull requests, or share your thoughts on the package.
