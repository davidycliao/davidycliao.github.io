# flairR: An R Wrapper for Accessing Flair NLP Tagging Features


## FlaiR - R wrapper for Flair NLP 


<div style="text-align: justify">



We are currently in the process of testing our package, which is an R wrapper designed specifically for Flair NLP. This package is tailored to provide core sequence tagging features, including part-of-speech tasks, named entity recognition, and transformer-based sentiment analysis.

One notable feature of our package is its ability to directly return a dataframe, which can be particularly useful for researchers in social or political science. Instead of returning complex objects, it simplifies the data output, making it more accessible and convenient for analysis.

Additionally, we have extended our wrapper to include essential Flair NLP Python modules, allowing you to import and use functionalities like transformers, training models, classification, and sequence tasks within the R environment.

We encourage you to engage with our package in various ways:

- You can fork our repository to contribute to its development, whether it's adding new features or enhancing existing ones.

- If you have suggestions for improvements or find any bugs, please submit pull requests to help us make the package more robust and reliable.

- Your thoughts and feedback on the package are highly valued. Sharing your experiences and suggestions will assist us in making it even better and more user-friendly.


We genuinely appreciate your interest and support in our project. If you have any questions or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
