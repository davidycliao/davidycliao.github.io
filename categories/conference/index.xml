    <description><![CDATA[Party Misperception, Party-voter Incongruence and Political Distrust The paper investigates how citizens&rsquo; misperception of party positions influences the perceived congruence between ideological preferences and positions of parties&rsquo; ideological position. We use a voter-level longitudinal data in the British Election Study in conjunction with data from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES). We take advantage of the panel structure of our data set and directly test two hypotheses relating to voters&rsquo; misperception of party positions relates to subjectively perceived incongruence, and the effect of perceived and actual incongruence on trust and satisfaction with politics.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Electoral Reform and Pork Barrel in Parliamentary Questions Measuring legislator behaviours and tendencies towards constituencies under different electoral systems is important. This paper quantitatively investigates this topic using the case of Taiwan Legislative Yuan and data on written parliamentary questions through an electoral reform from multi-member districts (MMD) to single-member districts (SMD). With existing labelled pork legislation, I train deep learning models using convolutional neural networks with an embedding layer extracted from Transformer BERT to detect pork-barrel features in parliamentary questions over time.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Factionalism and the Red Guards under Mao&rsquo;s China: Ideal Point Estimation Using Text Data In this paper, we design a new strain of text scaling method, Swordfish (Slogan-featured Wordfish), that takes advantage of the TextRank algorithm to extract the most representative political slogans in a given context and estimates Wordfish with those extracted text variables. We test this method using the case of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the historical archive of handwritten big-character posters and self-printed tabloids from 1966.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Electoral Reform and Disunited Polarization: Evidence from Legislative Roll Calls This article investigates the strategic (inter- and intra-) party positioning in response to an electoral system transition from single non-transferable vote (SNTV) to single-member districts (SMDs) by studying the electoral reform in Taiwan and provides empirical evidence to the following questions. Does the switch of electoral system from SNTV to SMDs mitigate political polarization among parties? Does it influence the intra-party unitedness (cohesiveness), and thus, change legislatorsâ€™ ideological positioning?]]></description>
