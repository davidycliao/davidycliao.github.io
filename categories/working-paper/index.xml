    <description><![CDATA[In this paper, we design a new strain of text scaling method, Swordfish (Slogan-featured Wordfish), that takes advantage of the TextRank algorithm to extract the most representative political slogans in a given context and estimates Wordfish with those extracted text variables. We test this method using the case of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the historical archive of handwritten big-character posters and self-printed tabloids from 1966. We estimate student protests&rsquo; ideal points by analyzing expressed political views in propaganda publications.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Parliaments carry many characteristics of collective actors, especially in relation to their historical constitutional struggles. At the same time, modern democratic parliaments are usually analyzed as institutional arenas for the competition between political parties as hierarchical organizations. In this paper, we review the results of important empirical studies suggesting that the activity even of democratic parliaments shows signs of collective agency in some respects. Analyzing a large text corpus of parliamentary speeches in the British House of Commons between 1988 and 2019, we develop a novel technique to identify and measure references to collective agency in parliamentary speeches directly.]]></description>
