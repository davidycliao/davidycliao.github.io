    <description><![CDATA[FlaiR - R wrapper for Flair NLP We are currently in the process of testing our package, which is an R wrapper designed specifically for Flair NLP. This package is tailored to provide core sequence tagging features, including part-of-speech tasks, named entity recognition, and transformer-based sentiment analysis.
One notable feature of our package is its ability to directly return a dataframe, which can be particularly useful for researchers in social or political science.]]></description>
